# FUNDRAINING FOLDER

## Introduction

[AfricaNdoto](https://africandoto.org/) it's an idea that was born in 2016 with the goal to provide better opportunities for the kids and families in Tanzania. That idea turns into a NGO that works to improve the future of many people.

Nowadays, the NGO has the goal to have their activity recognized in Spain and continuing work in projects to offer educational oportunities to Tanzanian children and to empower Tanzanian women. That's the main reason why we work with them to help to improve their website and their fundraising system.

Moreover we want to provide to their sponsors and volunteers a clearest envirorment to get informed and updated about the activity and projects of the organization.
